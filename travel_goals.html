        <h1><u>Places that I want to travel in my life</u></h1>
        <p>Welcome to one of my travel goals. On this website, 
            I want to showcase the best countries to visit.
            Since I was a child, it is one of my dreams to travel all around the world. 
            That is why the purpose of this website is to 
            organize the places that I want to visit. 
            This list is based on my own ranking, starting from the number
            5 to 1.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="content">
    <div id="singapore">
        <h2>5. Singapore</h2>
            <img src="https://i.ibb.co/mSCMyCM/singapore.png" alt="singapore picture">
            <p> My number 5 on the list will be Singapore. 
                The reason why I chose this place as number 5 because 
                it is near my hometown which is the Philippines. 
                What I love about this country is that it 
                has disciplined people of different races all over Asia. Hopefully, 
                if I have enough money I can finally go to this place.
            </p>
        </div>

    <div id="australia">
        <h2>4. Australia</h2>
            <img id="australia" src="https://i.ibb.co/4JzKrK7/australia.jpg" alt="australia picture" >
            <p> My number 4 will on the list will be Australia.
                It is rank number 4 in my rankings due to its geographic location
                which is quite near to the Philippines.
                I have close relatives in this country which can give me opportunities
                to travel to that place soon. 
                What I love about this country is its western culture despite it is
                found in the eastern part of the globe. This country has beautiful places
                ranging from white beaches to adventurous cities. In the near the future,
                I would definitely 
                go to this place. 
            </p>

    <div id="canada">
        <h2>3. Canada</h2>
           <img id="canada" src="https://i.ibb.co/CQsZHbL/canada.jpg" alt="canada picture">
           <p>Number 3 will belong to Canada. The reason why I chose Canada as number 3
            is because it has a breath-taking view in there.
            It is balanced with the city and nature in which I definitely like. 
            I also have a close relative in this country which can hopefully allow me to travel there.
            Even though the ticket price might be expensive, I hopefully pray that I could there. 
           </p>

    <div id="japan">
        <h2>2. Japan</h2>
            <img id="japan"src="https://i.ibb.co/hfbxyWP/japan.jpg" alt="japan picture">
            <p>Bring the drum rolls *drumrolls effect* The number 2 on the places that 
                I want to visit will be japan.
                Since I was a child, I love to watch anime, read manga, and even watch movies at the cinema.
                I was in love with Japanese culture.
                That is why I have decided to travel to Japan if I have enough budget. 
                Even though traveling to Japan might be the most expensive budget among all these 
                top 5 places, 
                the view there will surely be breath-taking. Ranging from tall buildings to 
                the sensational view of sakura trees, Japan will surely bring all things that 
                you want to your bucket list.
            </p>

    <div id="switzerland">
        <h2>1. Switzerland</h2>
            <img src="https://i.ibb.co/JKJk0k6/switzerland.jpg" alt="switzerland">
            <p>Finally! For my number 1 place that I want to visit will be Switzerland.
                Among the other four places, this country has the most beautiful and breath-taking
                view. This country is one of the ideal retirement vacations that I want to go to.
                The major reason why I love this place is because of its relaxing green sceneries 
                that nature has to offer. It makes me appreciate the creation that God made. 
                Hopefully in the future, I would travel to this place.
